“Professor Fu was fantastic. She was very patient with us, and she created an environment where everyone learned. 
She worked her hardest to allow students of all coding levels to learn in this class. I am so grateful for how easily she broke down machine learning. 
She is very talented at teaching. I would love to take a more advanced class with her!”

“Xinyu was very receptive to our mid–class feedback and made extremely beneficial changes to the course which I really enjoyed. 
The homework was very diverse and did not feel tedious. She lectured on the material while making sure to ask if we had any questions and guided us through difficult material.”
