“Professor Fu was fantastic. She was very patient with us, and she created an environment where everyone learned. 
She worked her hardest to allow students of all coding levels to learn in this class. I am so grateful for how easily she broke down machine learning. 
She is very talented at teaching. I would love to take a more advanced class with her!”
