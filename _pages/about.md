I am a doctoral student in the [Department of Information Systems & Technology Management](https://www.katz.business.pitt.edu/academics/phd/phd-istm), Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh. I am advised by [Professor. Narayan Ramasubbu](https://sites.google.com/site/narayanramasubbu/) and [Professor. Dennis Galletta](http://www.pitt.edu/~galletta/). 


My research is about human-bot collaboration. I study the impact of bot/robot in various contexts such as online platforms, online-to-offline (O2O), and education. Specifically, I focus on how the bot/robot change individuals' information searching behaviors and thus influence the process and quality of individuals' decision-making.
