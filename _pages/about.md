I am a doctoral student in the [Department of Information Systems & Technology Management](https://www.katz.business.pitt.edu/academics/phd/phd-istm), Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh. I am advised by [Professor. Narayan Ramasubbu](https://sites.google.com/site/narayanramasubbu/) and [Professor. Dennis Galletta](http://www.pitt.edu/~galletta/). 

My research focuses on **human-artificial intelligence (AI) complementarity**. This involves collaboration between humans and AI systems, building on each other's strengths, and compensating for each other's potential weaknesses. I examine configurations of human-AI hybrid teams in two streams of research. In one stream of research, I investigate the conditions and processes through which humans can complement AI (e.g., by detecting AI’s errors and improving overall performance) and AI can empower humans (e.g., by eliminating laborious, ergonomically inconvenient, and monotonous work). In a second stream of research, I investigate organizational and environmental challenges in designing human-AI collaboration configurations (e.g., data control and behavioral tracking policies).
