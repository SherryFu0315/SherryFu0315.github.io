I am a doctoral student in the [Department of Information Systems & Technology Management](https://business.pitt.edu/phd/phd-in-info-systems-and-tech-management/), Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh. I am advised by [Professor. Narayan Ramasubbu](https://sites.google.com/site/narayanramasubbu/) and [Professor. Dennis Galletta](http://www.pitt.edu/~galletta/). I am an ICIS Doctoral Consortium Fellow and Ben L. Fryrear Doctoral Fellow.

My research focuses on [human-artificial intelligence (AI) complementarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93artificial_intelligence_collaboration). This involves collaboration between humans and AI systems, building on each other's strengths, and compensating for each other's potential weaknesses. I investigate the conditions and processes through which humans can complement AI (e.g., by detecting AI’s errors and improving overall performance) and AI can empower humans (e.g., by eliminating laborious, ergonomically inconvenient, and monotonous work). Furthermore, I investigate organizational and environmental challenges in designing human-AI collaboration configurations (e.g., data control and behavioral tracking policies). In recognition of my research endeavors, I received the prestigious **Ben L. Fryrear Fellowship**, which is annually awarded to one student in the entire business school.

Beginning Fall 2023, I will be joining [the Department of Computer Information Systems in the Robinson College of Business](https://robinson.gsu.edu/academic-departments/computer-information-systems/), Georgia State University, as an Assistant Professor.

Recent work
