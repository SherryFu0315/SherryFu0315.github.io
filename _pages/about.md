I am a doctoral student in the [Department of Information Systems & Technology Management](https://business.pitt.edu/phd/phd-in-info-systems-and-tech-management/), Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh. I am advised by [Professor. Narayan Ramasubbu](https://sites.google.com/site/narayanramasubbu/) and [Professor. Dennis Galletta](http://www.pitt.edu/~galletta/). I am an ICIS Doctoral Consortium Fellow and Ben L. Fryrear Doctoral Fellow.

<p style="background-color: #FFFF00"><b>I am on the job market this year and I am happy to talk about potential opportunities!</b> I will present one recent work “Integrating imperfect machines and unmindful users: Assessing human-bot hybrid designs for managing discussions in online communities” during INFORMS 2022 (MB10. October 17, 2022, 11:00 AM - 12:15 PM; in CC - Room 110).</p>

My research focuses on [human-artificial intelligence (AI) complementarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93artificial_intelligence_collaboration). This involves collaboration between humans and AI systems, building on each other's strengths, and compensating for each other's potential weaknesses. I investigate the conditions and processes through which humans can complement AI (e.g., by detecting AI’s errors and improving overall performance) and AI can empower humans (e.g., by eliminating laborious, ergonomically inconvenient, and monotonous work). Furthermore, I investigate organizational and environmental challenges in designing human-AI collaboration configurations (e.g., data control and behavioral tracking policies). In recognition of my research endeavors, I received the prestigious **Ben L. Fryrear Fellowship**, which is annually awarded to one student in the entire business school.

I have independently taught two courses during my graduate training: (1) the undergraduate-level required core course [Introduction to Information Systems](https://catalog.upp.pitt.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=72&coid=376733), and (2) the MBA/MS elective course [Data Programming Essentials with Python](https://www.katz.business.pitt.edu/course/data-programming-python). I received **the 2021 Doris & Douglas Bernstein Doctoral Student Teaching Award** — one of the most prestigious awards given to doctoral students teaching at Pitt Business.

Recent work
------
* Fu, X., Ramasubbu, N., & Galletta, D. Managing imperfect algorithms: Error detection in collaborative human-AI decision making processes. Target journal: OBHDP.
  -	Improved error anticipation increases users’ perceived responsibility to monitor an imperfect algorithm, and enables users to improve their decision quality.
  -	Presented at [INFORMS 2022](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/indianapolis2022/), [ICIS 2021](https://icis2021.aisconferences.org/), [WAIM 2019](https://waim.network/).
* Fu, X., Ramasubbu, N., & Galletta, D. Empowering females in manufacturing: An investigation of collaborative robotics deployment and gender gap. Target journal: MIS Quarterly.
  -	A theory development case study about how collaborative bots (cobots) improve female workers’ labor force participation and address wage-related inequality.
* Fu, X., Janansefat, S., Ramasubbu, N., Kemerer, C., & Galletta, D. Misaligned signals and exploration behaviors in music streaming platforms: A field experiment. Target journal: ISR.
  -	Content displayed with misaligned social signals is perceived with high uncertainty, which motivates users to conduct further exploration.
  -	Combined field and lab experiments.
